# Cloud Computing Project 

### Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome, a.a 2023/2024

This project shows the development of a scalable and efficient **data platform** using AWS cloud services.
The platform is designed to manage, process, and analyze large datasets.
Key components of this architecture include Amazon S3 for data lake storage, AWS Glue for ETL processes, and Amazon Redshift for data warehousing.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles have been implemented using Terraform to automate the provisioning and management of AWS resources, ensuring scalability, and consistency across development and production environments.
